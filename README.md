# Parallelism-Benchmark
A simple benchmark test I've created for my Advanced Computer Architecture class.

The program simply calculates the product of two 1500x1500 matrix on a single thread, thereafter it splits the matrix
as evenly as possible and distributes it to threads.

Unfortunatly, due to some dependancies, the program will only run on Linux.
